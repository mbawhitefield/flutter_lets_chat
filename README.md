# flutter_lets_chat

1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
  Approximately 4 hours.

2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
  I would add more functions like delete messages, I will also invest on the beauty and aesthetics of the User interface

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do
this?
  Yes I have, by debuging and testing

4. What improvement would you suggest to the Firebase team if you had the chance?
  I would recommend a less expensive use of cloud function. To use cloud function, one has to upgrade to a paid plan which was inconvenient for me while buiding this app, because I needed to implement firebase cloud functions to implement live post notications with firebase messaging.
